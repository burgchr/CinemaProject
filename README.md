# Cinema Cashier Simulator

A Java application that simulates a cinema cashier experience. The user can order snacks and drinks, purchase tickets for movies, and be assigned a seat in a specific screening room. The application aims to replicate the real-world flow of a cinema box office, providing an interactive experience.

## Build and Run Instructions

## Project Description

This application simulates the user interface of a cinema cashier. It allows customers to:

- Order food and drinks (e.g., popcorn, soda, chips),
- Purchase tickets for movies,
- Be assigned a seat in a room with numbered rows and seats,
- Receive a printed receipt.

The simulation includes UI elements for selecting products, a real-time display of the total cost, and logic for room/seat allocation.

## User Guide

## Implementation Overview

### Project Structure and Components

The application is organized into multiple components following a modular and MVC-based approach. Below is an overview of the main parts:

#### Controllers
These Java classes manage logic and interaction between the UI (FXML) and backend:

- `MainController.java`: Central navigation logic; contains methods like `viewFood`, `viewIcecream`, `viewDrinks`, and `viewCombos`.
- `CheckoutController.java`: Manages the checkout process and receipt finalization.
- `OrderController.java`, `FoodController.java`, `IceCreamController.java`, `DrinksController.java`, `CombosController.java`: Handle user interactions for different product categories.
- `TopBarController.java`: Likely handles UI actions for the top navigation bar.

#### Models & Utilities
These files represent the data and support logic of the application:

- `Product.java`, `OrderItem.java`: Define products and items in a customerâ€™s order.
- `CardUtil.java`, `PdfUtil.java`: Utility classes for formatting payment and receipt-related features.

#### Testing
The project includes tests with JUnit:

- `CardUtilTest.java`, `OrderItemTest.java`, `PdfUtilTest.java`, `TicketItemTest.java`

#### FXML for UI Layouts
These files define the graphical layout using JavaFX:

- `main.fxml`, `checkout.fxml`, `order.fxml`, `food.fxml`, `ice_cream.fxml`, `drinks.fxml`, `combos.fxml`, `ticket.fxml`, `cards.xml`

Each FXML file corresponds to a screen or component of the user interface (e.g., snack selector, ticketing view).

### Interfaces Between Components

- Each `.fxml` layout is linked to a controller class that handles UI events and user inputs.
- The main controller (`MainController`) acts as a navigation hub to switch between different views and their respective controllers.
- Utility classes like `CardUtil` and `PdfUtil` are used across multiple controllers to handle recurring logic for example payment validation, receipt generation.

### Technologies & Techniques

- **JavaFX** for GUI development
- **JUnit** for unit testing
- **Object-Oriented Programming**
- **MVC** architecture
- **FXML** for UI separation from logic
- **Utility classes** for modular code reuse
